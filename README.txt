In this repo, you will find everything you need to compile and run my students database.


Contents:

DDL file(SQL)
DML file(SQL)
Python script file


By watching the youtube video linked below, you can follow along and create the database, populate it with data, and run the program via the python script
	- the video should answer any questions you have regarding on how to organize the database, or how to run the program


NOTE: The youtube video was uploaded before the original due date, you can check by looking at the time stamp. The reason for the files being uploaded now is because on a previous version of this repository, I accidentally left some sensitive information in my python script file, and was unable to delete it from the commit history. I talked with the professors, and they said that as long as the video was uploaded before the deadline, there would be no late penalty.
